# PHASE-A-_Enhancement-of-the-K-mismatch-search-algorithm-Via-tree-data-structures
This is the first phase of my final year projcet,This project is mine and my partner Sameer Kandeel.<br />
Our Project is Enhancement of the K-mismatch search algorithm Via tree data-structures.<br />
Our approach is based on the basic k-mismatch algorithm but with a major difference in the task of mapping/indexing the text (after building the MCS).<br />
The idea is building a data-structure that can map all the words from all the configurations in the text (instead of having a separate map for each configuration) , the data-structure consists of a dynamic-tree data structure and a dynamic-array.<br />
